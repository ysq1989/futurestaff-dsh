## Blue/white sidebar and update dialog 2.0.21 — published 2026-10-09

New Session belongs to the Session tab and is hidden on Menu; blue/white sidebar and branded update-ready modal. Primary action styling separated from safe Later focus/cancel; existing signed feed/cache recheck preserved. Source 8ca21cc61010cfbced14f0733bf25c123cafed86. Clean access 139 and desktop 1097 tests passed (13 existing skips), all build/type/closure and two Profile checks passed. Native assets/CSP, New Session placement, packaged Electron imports and 59 references verified. Signed live feed/full HTTPS installer: 130857106 bytes; SHA-256 08315a7c51147b30a9053ad787420ef8b43b5332c545d9b5badc94970ba5a972. Rollback 2.0.20. Local four UI files backed up/updated with custom Host preserved. User restart/update acceptance pending; new prompt appears after installation. Details: tasks/update-sidebar-ui-polish.md.

## Sidebar native-load acceptance fix 2.0.20 — published 2026-10-08

Fixed declaration-before-occupant timing with registration subscriptions and renderer version invalidation; fixed settings trigger visibility under native data-slot wrappers. Source ae3e0138d0f22ef5c68ee5a15f641c3dfa9cd968. Actual native renderer browser fixture verified both delayed native registration and product decoration after old UI was already mounted; account/tab/title/mode UI and initially hidden settings passed. Primary access 144 tests, clean access 139 tests, desktop 1095 tests (13 original skips), build/typecheck/closure and two staging tests passed. Packaged Electron imports/59 references and full public signature/download verified: 130856151 bytes, SHA-256 ff5985ea149516dad5514566847c2fae7680c547986e4dbb6ebdab1eab179c5b. Rollback 2.0.19.

## Branding and protected-password follow-up 2.0.18 — published 2026-10-08

Official blue/white f across hero, browser identity, recovery-window icon and installer artwork; retryable password-capability probe and clear errors. Missing local overlay brand.js repaired with custom Host integration preserved. Source 7f1eb3c832af6831db99e04ae44ff06953429dc4. Access 128 tests and desktop 1095 tests (13 existing skips), build/typecheck/runtime closure and two staging tests passed; actual packaged Electron imported both Host entrypoints and resolved 56 module references.

## Login UI and protected remember-password 2.0.17 — published 2026-10-08

Both login flows centered, concise titles, one-row subject buttons and opt-in OS-protected password remembering. No Renderer password export or plaintext preference persistence. 125 access tests, 1095 desktop tests (13 skips), two staging tests, browser centering checks and actual packaged fixture passed. Signed feed and complete HTTPS installer verified; rollback 2.0.16. Source 26d8eceddf; user restart/acceptance pending. Evidence: tasks/login-ux.md.

## Agent market recovery fix 2.0.16 — published 2026-10-08

Fixed required native preset default and one-time v1 workspace migration, plus ASAR preset asset copying. Repaired and backed up local market-owned files. 119 access tests, 1095 desktop tests (13 skips), real installed-schema and final bundled ASAR fixture passed.

Platform builtin templates run through local DSH presets. Platform source baaa9a45; packaged desktop 7b8267faac. DEV/PROD guarded deployment, signed stable feed and complete HTTPS installer verified. Local custom inference preserved through task-only code overlay. No database migration or installer execution; user restart and acceptance pending. Validation and rollback: tasks/agent-market.md.

## B11 — Website Logo, blue-white access and remembered login released 2.0.14 (2026-10-08)

- User authorized commit, push and publication. Source: 05b35f334e8571694bc2ecac826eebf70e8cc443 (UI source 0ce52bebee and existing workspace fix 05b35f334e).
- Original public website SVG is bundled offline in login/sidebar and app/tray icons; no visible platform endpoint label. Includes B10's blue-white palette and harmless account/subject hints, with offered-subject confirmation still authenticated by Platform.
- Required access/workspace/managed-settings composition reviewed; no business API/schema migration, production data change or service restart. Pending Douyin/window changes excluded, inference service not registered/exported, and original staged changes preserved. Existing identity workspaces receive only verified browser code; Host code, credentials, profile identity and history remain in place.
- Validation: affected access suite 110 passed; focused login/workspace checks 28 passed; fixed-profile refresh checks 13 passed; stable desktop 1092 passed, Beta 1029 passed, root 64 passed. Full npm check encountered one unchanged Beta test's Windows ephemeral-port EACCES; complete Beta retry and remaining root suite passed without modifying the test. Typechecks, builds, package preflight and Windows installer verification passed. Actual ASAR/profile confirms Logo, skin, hints, fixed-workspace client refresh, pinned update source and confirmed silent installation/relaunch.
- Live HTTPS download verified by the real client signature parser and complete size/SHA-256: 130937325 bytes; a5ddf84d165a51bd92ab372dc6d410fe5c80eb993b3d3b2ae56fb0e0da3f6b3d. Signed feed manifest: 0c927d07cf9010f115c9fd72699a05385ece22cefa5ffc5ec022dabb169b8764. Rollback 2.0.13 matches the previous signed live artifact.
- Published https://fsstory.net/desktop-updates/stable.json and the versioned 2.0.14 installer. Update server, Platform API and Product Hub API remain healthy at unchanged start times; trust.json and READY remain private (404). Real interactive installation/restart remains user acceptance; no installer executed on the user's desktop.
- Build hygiene follow-up: reused access lib contains three inactive inference helper outputs (inference.js/.d.ts/.js.map) from an earlier local build. They are not exported or loaded and do not activate inference. Before the next installer, clean generated product-package outputs and verify the staged inventory against fresh compilation; do not replace the already published immutable 2.0.14 artifact.

# Completed Atomic Tasks

## B10: Blue-white access UI and login hints (local implementation)

- Removed production endpoint label from login gate and access section.
- Successful account identifier is prefilled after logout/expiration; authenticated
  existing sessions seed first-use email hints. Subject defaults are stored by
  server user UUID and select only currently offered authorized subjects.
- No password, token, permission or role is cached; normal login and subject
  confirmation still validate on the server. Storage failure/corruption is optional.
- Public theme override adopts light once and uses blue/white desktop/access
  tokens. Subsequent explicit theme choices remain effective; upstream unchanged.
- Module build/typecheck, 113 module tests and scoped diff check passed. Actual
  browser screenshots verified login and subject views; AA token checks passed.
- Changes apply to the current working module, preserving pending production
  login/workspace implementation. No installer publication or production change.


## B09: Confirmed in-app software updates

- Completed 2026-10-08; source main `b8679b4377`, live version 2.0.13; ADR-018.
- Background download and verified private cache; ready notification/tray action;
  Restart and Update / Later. Later reuses cached bytes across process restarts.
  Confirmation rechecks signed current feed, confined cache path and exact bytes;
  NSIS receives /S --updated --force-run, then the app shuts down after spawn.
  Existing Authenticode-required delivery and all managed defaults remain intact.
- Verification: clean main full npm run check; stable 1,089, Beta 1,029, root 64
  tests; builds/typechecks/runtime/loader/operations gates and diff checks passed.
  Cache, junction/path, tamper, cancellation, background/later, changed-feed and
  failed-spawn regressions passed. Windows preflight 190 tests, installer check
  and actual ASAR source/trust/handoff inspection passed.
- Installer: `outputs/FutureStaff-Agent-2.0.13-x64-Setup.exe`, 132734849 bytes,
  SHA-256 `d61bfa114cb1d5e841025d833c30ea257cf2ff7016cc0f216e7753f2e6c77ba1`.
- Existing HTTPS update feed now advertises 2.0.13 and rollback 2.0.12. Actual
  client signature parser and external full download verified size/hash. Feed
  switched atomically; update container and business services were not restarted.
- Old 2.0.11/2.0.12 clients require one bridge install. No installer executed by
  agent; installed end-to-end upgrade/relaunch remains manual acceptance.

## B08: Managed FutureStaff desktop defaults

- Completed 2026-10-08; source main `f7d22242a1`, live version 2.0.12.
- Result: all profiles inherit enhanced mode, Mica with existing OS fallback,
  disabled market/browser access, loopback networking and all notifications.
  First-run/upgrade Setup is completed automatically. Desktop settings, frame
  mode picker and tray toggle are removed; Host validators and Market callback
  reject conflicting writes. Isolated Recovery Safe Mode remains available.
- Validation: clean main full `npm run check` passed; stable 1,073, Beta 1,029,
  root 63 tests, workspace/type/build/runtime/loader/operations checks. Windows
  package preflight passed 190 tests and installer verification. Actual ASAR
  inspection verified product identity, policy, launcher/UI guards and updater trust.
- Installer: `outputs/FutureStaff-Agent-2.0.12-x64-Setup.exe`, 132731801 bytes,
  SHA-256 `7552883adf0ff1dc3577bf0b879b0ee5f9981de7458676aca4dc2a73ac07e140`.
- Publication: `https://fsstory.net/desktop-updates/stable.json` verified by
  the actual client parser; external HTTPS full download matched size/hash.
  Rollback 2.0.11 preserved; existing update container serves the atomic feed/file
  change without restarts or business configuration changes.
- Installer not executed by agent; first installed-client UI acceptance remains manual.

## B05: Restore FutureStaff Agent DEV login on the existing Desktop shell

- Status: Completed locally as source commit `f890bce061` and release record `7042cc118d`; the user screenshot of installed 2.0.9 shows an authenticated chat workspace.
- Result: the packaged Profile safely upgrades the exact intact older login client, preserving modified Profiles; bounded account guidance distinguishes password, verification, membership, and Agent access failures.
- Verification: real DEV account login through API, client controller, Host route, and installed Electron form; full `npm run check`, Platform desktop-auth 20 tests, temporary Profile upgrade/preservation, installer verification and independent SHA-256 comparison passed.
- Artifact: unsigned private `outputs/FutureStaff-Agent-2.0.9-x64-Setup.exe`, SHA-256 `0e7be4cfc9afbfc49e1ade43c710925cffa434512dd7872d3fc1e0657af723f3`. Chat model access belongs to B06.

## B01a: Connect the desktop product to the pinned local platform Mock

- Status: Completed and pushed as `71174081fbbcd377f61c0abf4fb1874de84199ce`.
- Contract: `0.1.0`, platform commit `93ca162566225894a8cd317b7bc51b096d16a0ec`, bundle SHA-256 `5ae4e07157b5c7c1b8007f514d47cc0bb05734841341f59c44c37a978b7f9fe9`.
- Result: login, refresh, logout, tenant discovery/switching, authorized applications, explicit state rendering, and tenant-change isolation run against the loopback-only Mock.
- Verification: 11 focused plugin tests, full product check, local Mock smoke, visible browser flow, Profile installation, and exact diff review passed.
- Known follow-up: the pinned DSH `0.1.1-rc.2` `pnpm dlx` launcher could not resolve its declared `dsh-app-boot` dependency on this Windows host.

## B01b: Make the FutureStaff Profile release-loadable

- Status: Completed and pushed as `570fa30af6723005b8d9a8498d9a9056094dd00a`.
- Result: repository-pinned DSH `0.1.2-rc.1`, successful development/release Profile composition, and a relocatable built-only Profile tree without absolute paths or links.
- Verification: release Profile tests, full product checks, exact file inspection, and `profile:dump:release` passed.

## B01c: Integrate the release Profile with the controlled desktop shell

- Status: Completed and pushed as `ab7f5f11a6b8eac2bed6bb2b52040760ebf6c763`; controlled-shell support was pushed as `3e3b3fd822d1510f82d7831f10ea4618701f07f5`.
- Result: verified first-launch Profile installation, preservation of existing user data, packaged-resource gates, and exact cross-repository staging.
- Verification: desktop focused and Windows package gates plus the product full check passed; known unrelated Windows environment failures remain recorded in the completed task history.

## B01d: Export a self-contained private Windows Mock installer

- Status: Completed in the B01d close commit. Desktop artifact-name verification was pushed as `8f7dbd6ce960daa1e80a96010488b982932381bd`.
- Result: the packaged Host runs the pinned B01a contract through an in-process Mock, while retaining the loopback bridge, explicit simulated metadata, all session states, and tenant-change cleanup. No Python service, real account, credential, signing, publishing, or cloud deployment is required.
- Artifact: ignored private Alpha `FutureStaff-Agent-2.0.5-x64-Setup.exe`, 134,257,457 bytes, SHA-256 `22fdb50439094ae3ae434c587a90b009cb3db9e353a1a7dd9c69d084b21e83c1`.
- Verification: product full check, embedded Mock integration tests, release Profile checks, 188 Windows package tests, 228-node runtime closure, NSIS build, installer/application PE verification, independent SHA-256 comparison, and unsigned Authenticode status check passed.

## B01e: Enforce the pinned A01 response contract at the client boundary

- Status: Completed.
- Contract: A01 `0.1.0`, platform commit `93ca162566225894a8cd317b7bc51b096d16a0ec`, bundle SHA-256 `5ae4e07157b5c7c1b8007f514d47cc0bb05734841341f59c44c37a978b7f9fe9`.
- Result: success and error payloads now fail closed on invalid/extra fields, UUIDs, integer TTL limits, roles, user fields, HTTP(S) URLs, application IDs, deep links, duplicate or malformed capabilities, metadata, logout revocation limits, and unknown error codes. All decoder failures become a bounded local `CONTRACT_MISMATCH` without reflecting payloads or credentials.
- TDD: five new negative cases first failed against the permissive decoder, then passed after strict boundary validation.
- Verification: platform-access tests 18 passed; focused TypeScript check passed; original A01 Python Mock smoke completed login, refresh, tenant list/switch, application discovery, and logout; full `npm run check` passed, including every workspace typecheck/test/build and 50 top-level tests; `git diff --check` passed with only line-ending conversion warnings.
- Boundaries: no A02 endpoints or fields were guessed; no platform or controlled-desktop repository files changed; no real identity, credential, service, signing, publishing, deployment, or external write was used.

## B01f: Polish the local Mock access center

- Status: Completed and committed locally on `main`; not pushed.
- Result: the Settings access panel now presents polished signed-out, loading, expired, error, empty, and ready states; tenant selection, active role, application count, and capability labels remain explicit.
- Accessibility: labelled regions and tenant control, live loading and alert semantics, button types, visible keyboard focus, responsive single-column layouts, and reduced-motion handling were added.
- Safety: all account, tenant, application, and capability strings remain HTML-escaped; no credentials are rendered or logged.
- Demo: the local browser demo now shares the production panel styles and uses the existing embedded A01 Mock, so it does not depend on A02 or a separate process.
- Verification: TDD regression coverage first failed against the old markup; platform-access tests passed 21/21; full `npm run check` passed; desktop and 390px browser checks passed with no horizontal overflow and a visible 3px keyboard focus outline; `git diff --check` passed with only Git line-ending conversion warnings; exact diff review passed.
- Boundaries: no A02 endpoint or field was added; no Computer A or controlled-desktop file changed; no real account, persistence, external write, deployment, commit, or push was used.

## B02a: Pin A02 and add the Platform DEV API boundary

- Status: Completed and committed as `9e7774401a1d841e746f49c499d62efea76a1112`; pushed with the B02b close.
- Contract: A02 `0.1.1`, Platform DEV source `d789faceb7971deb111fec3e4948237d21e81346`, handoff `2c31ed720d8f9ee4fd8087f758c928ea5f8c0ac2`, bundle SHA-256 `9921cc5084925ceea4e6e9d224e5434d4af294974a736a300ed34c73d2950687`.
- Result: the foundation now pins independent A01 Mock and A02 DEV inputs; `PlatformDevApi` supports the existing desktop identity routes and strict one-minute application-token exchange at the exact root-level DEV origin.
- Safety: the DEV boundary rejects `/api`, alternate origins, simulated or wrong-version metadata, unsafe application IDs, cross-tenant token responses, invalid token TTL/audience/permissions, malformed envelopes, and unbounded transport failures without reflecting credentials.
- Compatibility: the immutable `0.1.0` Mock, its six routes, proof headers, embedded implementation, and disconnected UI remain unchanged; the application-token endpoint was not added to the Mock.
- Verification: RED tests failed before the DEV export and nested contract pin existed; platform-access tests passed 27/27; focused foundation/profile tests passed 8/8; full `npm run check` passed including every workspace typecheck/test/build and 52 top-level tests; `git diff --check` passed with only Git line-ending conversion warnings; exact diff review passed.
- Boundaries: no real login, credential storage, Platform DEV call, Computer A or controlled-desktop edit, deployment, or push was performed.

## B02b: Add OS-protected desktop session storage

- Status: Desktop portion committed and pushed as `bd54da63577a5d2595ced66060999e12468f42a8`; product portion and updated desktop release pin are recorded by this B02b close commit.
- Desktop result: added the generation-scoped, Host-only `desktopProtectedSecrets` Cordis service backed by Electron `safeStorage`; keys are validated and hashed, state is atomically written with private permissions, symlink/path/state hazards fail closed, and only sealed bytes reach disk.
- Product result: added `PlatformSessionVault` for the exact A02 `0.1.1` session/user shape with OS-protection gating, local-first idempotent clear, presence-only credential-free diagnostics, and bounded failures.
- TDD: missing service/Vault tests first failed, then passed; added first-run empty operations, corruption, unavailable protection, invalid runtime input, no-diagnostic-decryption, and plaintext-at-rest checks.
- Verification: product full `npm run check` passed, including every workspace typecheck/test/build and 52 top-level tests; desktop build and typecheck passed; the focused protected-secret suite passed 5/5. Desktop full check reached 1019 passed and 12 skipped tests, with two reproducible unrelated environment failures in diagnostic-export linked-directory setup and recovery pnpm PATH selection. The edited service documents have matching bilingual blob records; the repository-wide bilingual gate remains red only because the unchanged Desktop README pair already has stale recorded hashes.
- Documentation: updated the bilingual public Desktop Host service contract and product/foundation integration boundaries.
- Boundaries: no renderer/IPC/browser storage, real account, DEV request, PKCE launch, deployment, or upstream Harness edit was performed.

## B02c: Add the desktop PKCE transaction boundary

- Status: Completed locally; not committed or pushed.
- Result: added `PlatformPkceTransaction`, which generates a 32-byte verifier and state, derives the S256 challenge, builds only the pinned A02 authorization request, and consumes only the exact loopback callback once.
- Safety: verifier remains in Host memory and is absent from the authorization URL and diagnostics; concurrent start, callback origin/path/query changes, duplicate parameters, invalid code/state, state mismatch, expiry, and replay fail with bounded messages; callback attempts destroy the pending transaction.
- TDD: the missing exports failed first, then three focused PKCE scenarios passed, including pinned URL fields, verifier secrecy, one-time success, pending collision, state mismatch, expiry, and callback rejection.
- Verification: platform-access tests passed 34/34; full `npm run check` passed including all workspace typechecks/tests/builds and 52 top-level tests; `git diff --check` passed with only line-ending conversion warnings.
- Boundaries: no listener, browser launch, DEV request, real account, code exchange, credential persistence, renderer secret, deployment, commit, or push was performed.

## B02d: Orchestrate PKCE exchange into the protected Vault

- Status: Completed locally; not committed or pushed.
- Result: added `PlatformDevLoginCoordinator` to compose one PKCE callback, the pinned `PlatformDevApi` exchange, and `PlatformSessionVault` persistence without returning the decoded session.
- Safety: only one exchange may run; API output is strictly decoded before save; protected-save failure triggers best-effort refresh-token revocation; transaction, exchange, storage, and diagnostics failures are bounded and do not reflect native errors or credentials.
- TDD: missing coordinator exports failed first, then success and protected-storage failure/revocation scenarios passed.
- Verification: platform-access tests passed 36/36 with build and TypeScript compilation; `git diff --check` passed with only line-ending conversion warnings.
- Boundaries: no listener, browser launch, real DEV request/account, renderer credential, deployment, commit, or push was performed.

## B02e: Mount the exact loopback DEV callback service

- Status: Completed locally; not committed or pushed.
- Result: Desktop Host now conditionally provides `platformDevLogin` when `desktopProtectedSecrets` exists; `begin()` owns a temporary dedicated `127.0.0.1:43821` listener because the ordinary DSH WebServer remains on its separate configured port.
- Safety: only GET, loopback socket, exact `Host: 127.0.0.1:43821`, bounded URL length, and the strict PKCE callback are accepted; fixed CSP/no-store HTML never reflects query data or credentials; the listener closes after success, failure, cancellation, runtime error, or five-minute expiry.
- Verification: integration coverage completed a fake DEV exchange through a real loopback socket and found only OS-protected persisted state; platform-access tests passed 37/37; full `npm run check` passed with every workspace typecheck/test/build and 52 top-level tests; `git diff --check` passed with line-ending warnings only.
- Boundaries: no browser launch, real DEV request/account, renderer credential, deployment, commit, or push was performed.

## B02f: Add the safe Host-to-client login trigger

- Status: Completed locally; not committed or pushed.
- Result: added a loopback-only Host POST start route and `beginPlatformDevLogin()`, which validates the exact A02 authorization URL before asking the controlled desktop window to open it externally.
- Safety: the start route requires a non-simple `X-FutureStaff-Login` header to force browser CORS preflight for cross-origin attempts; the client rejects extra response fields, alternate origins/paths, URL credentials/fragments, missing or duplicate parameters, wrong client/callback/method, and malformed state/challenge before invoking the opener.
- Verification: a real loopback start route plus dedicated callback completed the fake DEV/Vault flow; safe and malicious client URL cases passed; platform-access tests passed 38/38; full `npm run check` passed including every workspace typecheck/test/build and 52 top-level tests.
- Boundaries: the existing Mock panel remains unchanged; no real account/DEV request, session restore, deployment, commit, or push was performed.

## B02g: Restore the protected DEV session into the Settings access center

- Status: Completed locally; not committed or pushed.
- Result: added a Host-owned `PlatformDevAccessController` that restores the A02 session from the OS-protected Vault, loads the validated user/tenant/application context, persists refresh and tenant-switch sessions, and clears the protected local session before best-effort remote logout.
- Web boundary: added four loopback Host session routes guarded by `X-FutureStaff-Session`; every response is a credential-free snapshot. The Web client strictly decodes every nested field, rejects extra or credential-shaped output, ignores stale responses, opens B02f login in the system browser, and restores on desktop focus. A definite missing desktop route retains the A01 Mock workflow.
- Tenant and concurrency safety: the Host accepts a switch only for a tenant in the server-fetched membership set, serializes protected session mutations, validates active-tenant consistency, clears expired credentials and tenant resources, and maps application denial to the safe empty state.
- UI: the Settings access center distinguishes Platform DEV `0.1.1` from local Mock `0.1.0`, keeps loading/error/expired/empty states and keyboard semantics, and introduces no new UI dependency or theme system.
- Verification: RED coverage first failed on the missing DEV controller; platform-access tests passed 46/46 with TypeScript build; a fake protected-session flow completed browser start, loopback callback, Vault restore, safe Web snapshot, refresh/switch/logout boundaries, malformed response rejection, concurrent mutation serialization, and stale response rejection; full `npm run check` passed including every workspace typecheck/test/build and 52 top-level tests; `git diff --check` passed with line-ending conversion warnings only.
- Boundaries: no real account, real Platform DEV request, credential read outside fake tests, schema, deployment, controlled-desktop edit, commit, or push was performed.

## B02h: Broker the short-lived Product Hub application token

- Status: Completed locally after commit `d2b1f7c`; not committed or pushed.
- Result: the Host-owned DEV controller now mints an A02 application token only when `product_hub` is present in the current server-fetched application snapshot and the protected session still matches the active tenant. Issuance is serialized with refresh, tenant switch, restore, and logout.
- Web boundary: added one exact loopback POST route guarded by `X-FutureStaff-Application: product_hub`; its response is `no-store` and contains only the 60-second application credential contract. `getProductHubApplicationToken()` validates the exact active tenant, audience, TTL, visible-ASCII token, unique `product_hub.*` permissions, and response fields, then returns without caching or persistence.
- Safety: missing/expired sessions, unauthorized applications, cross-tenant responses, unsafe tokens, malformed permissions, missing guard headers, extra fields, and post-logout issuance fail closed with bounded errors. The platform access token and refresh token never enter the Web response.
- Verification: RED tests first failed on the missing controller method and client helper; platform-access tests passed 48/48 with TypeScript build; the real loopback fake flow covered Host minting and Web delivery; full `npm run check` passed including every workspace typecheck/test/build and 52 top-level tests; `git diff --check` passed with line-ending conversion warnings only.
- Boundaries: no Product Hub business request, real Platform DEV request, credential persistence in Web, schema, deployment, controlled-desktop edit, commit, or push was performed.

## B02i: Connect the Product Hub client to the desktop authorization boundary

- Status: Completed locally after commit `d2b1f7c`; not committed or pushed.
- Result: the live Product Hub approval page now accepts only a valid `draft` UUID, resolves the current Product Hub endpoint and tenant from the strict credential-free Host snapshot, obtains a fresh 60-second application token per business request, and sends the server-owned draft/approval contract through `ProductHubApprovalClient`.
- Tenant and permission safety: every token mint revalidates the active tenant, application authorization, and base URL; a switch or revocation fails before Product Hub is called. Only server-issued `product_hub.operator` or `product_hub.admin` enables approval, while read-only users can inspect the draft without a writable control.
- Mutation safety: approval transmits only title, allowlisted template, and a client-generated idempotency key; an identical retry reuses that key. Platform credentials and tenant IDs never enter the Product Hub request body, Web storage, or logs.
- Verification: fake loopback integration proved snapshot -> token -> business request ordering and rejected switched tenants, missing applications, and read-only approval; platform-access tests passed 49/49; Product Hub UI tests passed 15/15 and its Vite production build passed; full `npm run check` passed before the final permission-interface tightening, followed by the affected tests/build and `git diff --check` passing.
- Boundaries: no real Platform DEV account/request, Product Hub business request, external mutation, schema, controlled-desktop edit, commit, push, or server deployment was performed.

## B02j: Build and stage the private Windows client candidate

- Status: Completed locally after commit `d2b1f7c`; source changes remain uncommitted and unpushed.
- Result: staged the built-only `futurestaff-alpha` Profile into the pinned controlled desktop shell at `bd54da63577a5d2595ced66060999e12468f42a8`, built exactly one private unsigned Windows x64 installer, and exported it to `outputs/FutureStaff-Agent-2.0.5-x64-Setup.exe`.
- Artifact: 134,282,271 bytes; SHA-256 `ebac3e3fe0f052951bff105884e9bd49fef85369d8f4ed60c2c289aa7686cf77`; companion `.sha256` file exported beside it. Authenticode is intentionally absent for this private Alpha candidate.
- Verification: controlled desktop `main` and its official DSH gitlink were clean before packaging and remained clean afterward; desktop tests passed 188/188; the first-party runtime closure contained 228 reachable nodes; Electron/NSIS packaging and the installer verification gate exited 0; the staged release manifest pins A01 Mock `0.1.0`, A02 DEV `0.1.1`, exact built file hashes, and `productionEnabled: false`.
- Boundaries: the installer contains the mounted Profile packages `fs-core` and `fs-platform-access`, including B02h. The separately built Product Hub approval UI/B02i is not yet mounted as a DSH Profile navigation plugin and therefore is not claimed as installed by this artifact. No installer execution, signing, public upload, real login, server deployment, migration, Product Hub mutation, commit, or push was performed.

## B02k: Mount Product Hub UI in the DSH Profile

- Status: Completed locally after commit `d2b1f7c`; not committed, pushed, or packaged into a new installer.
- Result: `fs-product-hub-ui` is now a DSH Host/Web plugin in both developer and release Profiles. It contributes an additive Product Hub action to `sidebar.footer.action` and a dismissible `shell.overlay`, preserving the official sidebar, conversation, and details occupants.
- Static boundary: the Host serves only allowlisted built `lib/ui` assets from the fixed loopback `/_futurestaff/product-hub-ui` prefix. Responses use a restrictive CSP, no-store, no-referrer, nosniff, explicit MIME types, and reject non-loopback, unsupported methods, traversal, and unknown files.
- Client boundary: only a valid outer `productHubDraft` UUID is transferred into the isolated same-origin UI as `draft`; missing or malformed values open the safe empty state. The overlay has an accessible dialog name, focused close control, and Escape dismissal. B02i continues to revalidate tenant/application state and mint a fresh 60-second token for each business call.
- Release integration: developer install, release build, Profile manifest, staging verifier, and composition tests now include exact `@futurestaff/fs-product-hub-ui@0.1.0`. The final staged Profile contains only package metadata, compiled `lib`, hashed Vite assets, and public SVG fixtures—no source, tests, absolute source paths, sessions, or credentials.
- Verification: Product Hub package typecheck/build and 18/18 tests passed; Host route and client slot interaction tests passed; release/Profile focused tests passed 8/8; `npm run profile:dump:release` showed `futurestaff-product-hub-ui` in the final DSH tree; final `npm run check` exited 0 including all workspaces and 52/52 top-level tests; `git diff --check` passed with line-ending warnings only.
- Boundaries: no real account, Platform DEV request, Product Hub business request, installer rebuild, installer execution, desktop-shell edit, signing, public upload, server deployment, commit, or push was performed.

## B02l: Make the bundled Profile first-launch safe

- Status: Completed by product commit `644322f` and controlled desktop commit `ab7a889b9e`; included in the verified replacement installer recorded under B02n.
- Incident: the private Windows candidate copied the three built first-party packages into `node_modules` but omitted pnpm layout metadata. On a fresh installation the desktop migration detector treated that verified package tree as legacy, invoked packaged pnpm, and entered recovery mode when the private package versions could not be materialized from a registry.
- Result: release staging now emits deterministic pnpm 11 hoisted-layout workspace, modules, and lock metadata before hashing the Profile. Release verification requires the exact metadata contract, so a future installer cannot silently ship the same incomplete dependency state. On upgrade, the desktop atomically repairs only the exact hash-matched defective Profile; any changed managed file or unexpected extra file preserves the user's Profile untouched.
- Verification: the focused regression failed before the fix and then passed 2/2; the staged Profile returned `requiresDependencyMigration=false` through the real desktop preparation function on Windows; release Profile composition included all three FutureStaff plugins; full `npm run check` passed, including every workspace and 52/52 top-level tests.
- Boundaries: no existing user Profile was deleted or modified, no real account or service was contacted, and no installer was executed, signed, or publicly uploaded.

## B02m: Bootstrap the desktop Alpha identity policy

- Status: Completed in controlled desktop commit `2a0a98fac0`; included in the verified replacement installer recorded under B02n.
- Incident: after the dependency-layout repair, the packaged Profile reached Host composition but `fs-core` correctly rejected the missing `FUTURESTAFF_IDENTITY_MODE` before any plugin could start.
- Result: the desktop Host now injects the explicit `single-subject` mode plus fixed bootstrap-only tenant/user labels whenever the reserved `futurestaff-alpha` Profile is selected. It overwrites caller-controlled environment values for that Profile and leaves every unrelated Profile untouched.
- Security: the bootstrap labels are not application authorization and are never accepted as a Platform tenant choice. A02 remains the authority for authenticated user, active tenant, application grants, and short-lived Product Hub credentials.
- Verification: the regression failed before implementation; identity, Profile repair, migration, and preparation tests passed 52/52 with desktop build/typecheck; final product checks and replacement packaging passed under B02n.

## B02n: Emit DSH-compatible client plugin bundles

- Status: Completed by product commit `646ad93` and controlled desktop commit `2887e6d5c3`; replacement installer built and verified.
- Incident: both FutureStaff Web plugins exposed raw TypeScript-emitted ESM as their DSH `./client` entry. The Host concatenated those files into a classic script, whose unsupported top-level imports prevented every factory registration and surfaced as a misleading failure on the first official plugin.
- Result: each package now keeps its importable ESM under `lib/client/index.js` and emits a separate `lib/client.js` factory bundle that registers its exact package ID through `__ModuleLoader__`. Release staging parses and executes both bundle shells as a regression gate.
- Upgrade safety: the packaged manifest explicitly supersedes the exact prior candidate manifest digest. Controlled desktop commit `2887e6d5c3` atomically upgrades only that fully hash-matched bundled Profile; managed-file changes or unexpected files remain preserved.
- Artifact: `outputs/FutureStaff-Agent-2.0.5-x64-Setup.exe`, 134,344,753 bytes, SHA-256 `49dbe0733e3f4d22d31b2f725a4551629533f24748d73607fe9d6d117e668ccc`; the adjacent sidecar matches. Authenticode remains intentionally absent for this private Alpha build.
- Verification: product full `npm run check` passed, including 49 platform-access tests, 18 Product Hub tests, and 52 top-level tests; release Profile composition passed; desktop upgrade tests passed 9/9 with build/typecheck; the Windows packaging gate passed 188/188 tests and a 228-node closed runtime graph before verifying the final installer.
- Boundaries: no user Profile was modified, no installer was executed, no real Platform request was made, and no push or public distribution occurred.

## B02p: Merge the product and desktop repositories

- Status: completed locally by desktop-history merge commit `f6b685b888` and monorepo integration commit `358f194f93`.
- Result: `futurestaff-dsh` now owns the complete desktop shell under `desktop-shell/`; root commands install, build, check, stage, and package both product and desktop code without consulting the adjacent legacy checkout.
- Provenance: the imported desktop tip is `89f84fcb7856746cdbdb664989547fc835ea8179`; `deepseek-harness` remains a root-managed submodule pinned to `a66e4702047846cdaa10c66c9d3df3951f5ea70d`.
- Artifact: `outputs/FutureStaff-Agent-2.0.6-x64-Setup.exe`, 134,448,311 bytes, SHA-256 `3d1647f3c9bba99c382abbf3704b9c1a71f4bec49173792957a4cb71fdb63dc7`; the sidecar matches and Authenticode is intentionally `NotSigned`.
- Verification: embedded-foundation and release-path tests passed 9/9; product workspace checks and builds passed; stable desktop passed 109 files and 1028 tests with 13 skips; Beta passed 108 files and 1029 tests with 13 skips; the Windows packaging gate passed 190/190 with a 228-node runtime closure; bilingual documents, package variants, licenses, operation reliability, NSIS packaging, and final installer verification passed.
- Boundaries: the adjacent `futurestaff-dsh-desktop` checkout remains untouched as recoverable history. No push, deployment, signing, distribution, installer execution, legacy-repository deletion, or production mutation was performed.

## B02q: Automatically apply FutureStaff first-launch defaults

- Status: completed by product commit `abebcbd7ea17926a52c2bc3a4f25543fd85b7860`; no replacement installer has been built.
- Result: `futurestaff-alpha` no longer opens the generic DSH Setup Wizard. The launcher automatically records compatibility mode, ordinary Windows material, disabled plugin market, no browser access, loopback-only networking, enabled desktop notifications, and the completed Setup marker before continuing to the FutureStaff login gate.
- Boundary: only the reserved bundled product Profile receives the automatic policy. Generic DSH Profiles retain the complete interactive Wizard, and authentication, tenant authority, platform model ownership, and credentials are unchanged.
- Verification: focused product Profile/distribution/package tests passed 50/50 with TypeScript typecheck; the complete desktop gate passed with stable 109 files and 1029 tests plus 13 skips, Beta 108 files and 1029 tests plus 13 skips, both 228-node runtime closures, bilingual documents, variants, licenses, and operation reliability.
- Operations: the source was committed locally; no push, installer rebuild or execution, signing, distribution, deployment, or production mutation was performed.
